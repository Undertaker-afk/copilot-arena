      The user has requested a section of code in a file to be rewritten.
      
      This is the prefix of the file:
      ```{language}
      {prefix}
      ```

      This is the suffix of the file:
      ```{language}
      {suffix}
      ```

      This is the code to rewrite:
      ```{language}
      {code_to_edit}
      ```

      You are an expert programmer. You will rewrite the above code to do the following:

      {user_input}

      Keep in mind indentations. Output only a code block with the rewritten code:


stop_tokens:
  - "<|eom_id|>"
  - "</CODE>"
  - "<SUFFIX>"
  - "</SUFFIX>"
  - "<PREFIX>"
  - "</PREFIX>"

start_phrases:
  - "<CODE>\n"

args:
  - prefix
  - suffix
  - language
  - code_to_edit
  - user_input
